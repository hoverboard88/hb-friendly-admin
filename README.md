# Friendly Wordpress Admin
Makes Wordpress Admin less crappy by removing unwanted stuff for clients.

This plugin was really created by Cliff Seal with his [Starter Gist](https://gist.github.com/logoscreative/f881dd0473dd60a687d0). Thanks for his hard work on this!

This plugin is tweaked for our clients, but feel free to fork. You'll want to change the username sniffing on ~line 227 (near the end).
